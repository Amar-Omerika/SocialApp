# About

This is a mini social App that I had the opportunity to develop at intership in Zen Dev. The concept of this application would be to have one super admin who sets a daily task, then we have other users that could mark that task as done, or leave a comment and give their opinion about that task. Also every user would have the opportunity to respond to that post, by posting their own post that they have done that task.Also user has a option to edit his profile, and like other users posts.
